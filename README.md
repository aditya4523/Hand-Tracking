Hand Tracking using MediaPipe & OpenCV

🚀 Real-Time Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition

This project uses MediaPipe Hands and OpenCV to track hand landmarks in real time and recognize gestures based on finger positions.


📌 Features

✔ Real-time hand landmark detection using MediaPipe Hands

✔ Tracks individual fingers and detects gestures (e.g., number signs)

✔ Uses OpenCV for video processing and visualization

✔ Optimized for low-latency performance on CPU


🛠 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (Computer Vision)

MediaPipe Hands (Google's AI-based hand tracking)

🎯 How It Works

Captures video from the webcam

Detects 21 hand landmarks using MediaPipe

Determines which fingers are extended or folded

Maps hand positions to gestures or numbers (1-5)

Displays real-time tracking with visual overlays

📥 Installation
